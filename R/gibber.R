#' gibber: a package for detecting gibberish text.
#'
#' A recurrent neural network was trained to recognize gibber in text. For this purpose,
#' dataset was used that contains 700.000 English words (50% gibberish words/50% natural words).
#' Special care was taken to avoid overfitting and an accuracy of 97% was achieved on a validation
#' dataset, thereby guaranteeing generalizable results.
